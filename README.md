## Kamailio Project created with the Real-Time Communications (RTC) Lab at the Illinois Institute of Technology Mies Campus
- - -
  This project aims to configure Kamailio as a proxy server. The Kamailio server can check for calls intended for emergency services (911) and route these calls to a Session Border Controller (SBC). This SBC will then route the call to its final destination at the Public Safety Access Point (PSAP) where it can be answered by emergency operators in the EsiNet. 
  In this experiment, an Emergency Call Routing Function (ECRF) will not be used and instead the Kamailio proxy server is trusted to handle routing by itself. Future iterations should note the location of callers to more effectively assist emergency responders and increase protection from DDOS/DOS attacks. 
  
  The SBC is held in the Real-Time Communication (RTC) Lab on the Mies campus of the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT or Illinois Tech) in Chicago, Illinois. The PSAP used in place is monitored at Illinois Techâ€™s Rice campus in Wheaton, Illinois. 

Team A is made up of Jason Cheng, Lina Kang, and Joshua Prila. Team B has Rishon Dass and Amrutya LNU.
